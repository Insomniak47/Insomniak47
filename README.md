## Whats up

I'm @Insomniak47 a software engineer & transplant from mechanical engineering. I enjoy strongly typed programming languages, abusing type systems for my benefit and writing spooky complex things behind simple interfaces to make everybody more productive. 

I love learning the deep dark parts of the languages and frameworks I work in. I love DevOps and I think it's a part of every engineer's responsibilities. 

- Languages:
  - C# (netcore)
  - C++ 
  - Python
 
- Tools:
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - Terraform
  - Packer
  - [Way more]
